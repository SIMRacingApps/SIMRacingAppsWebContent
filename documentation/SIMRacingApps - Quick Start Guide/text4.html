<h1>Launching SIMRacingApps Clients</h1>
<ul>
<li>You will need to know the IP address of the computer running the server. This can be found in the title bar of the SIMRacingApps Server Window.</li>
<ul>
<li>For example (this is mine): @ <a href="http://192.168.1.61/">http://192.168.1.61</a> or http://192.168.1.61:port</li>
<li>Please be aware that this address may change over time, maybe from day to day, based on the settings in your router’s DNS lease times. If you do not want it to change, search the web for information on how to make your computer use a static IP address that is not within the Dynamic DNS range of your router and not used by any other devices on your network.</li>
<li>Please “Allow” the server to run when you see the Java Security pop-up window from Windows Firewall. You may have to re-confirm this every time Java is updated. More information can be found at <a href="https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues">https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>If your IP address does not change, then SIMRacingApps Apps and Widgets can be bookmarked. Once you launch it for the first time from the main page, simply save it as a favorite. Later you may want to add optional arguments to the URL to change its’ behavior. To add an argument add a question mark(?) to the end of the URL, then the key value pairs separated by an ampersand(&amp;).</li>
<ul>
<li>http://{IP:port}/SIMRacingApps/WidgetLoader?widget=TrackMap&amp;TEXTTYPE=initials</li>
</ul>
<li>One final note, hopefully the server is running on a computer behind your router/firewall and therefore not accessible from the outside world. There are ways around this by setting up your router to allow it, but do this at your own risk. There is no security in the server from anyone connecting to it and seeing what your doing and sending pit commands to the SIM or modifying your settings.</li>
</ul>
