/**
 * This is the Spotter, Broadcaster App for 60 cars.
 * With this App you can see what's going on from a none driver's point of view.
 * You can change the Camera angle, the car to focus on and control the replay postion.
 *
 * Note that when the reference car is not you, SIMs do not always transmit the same amount of data for other cars.
 * For example, one common complaint is iRacing does let you see the fuel or tire measurements of other cars.
