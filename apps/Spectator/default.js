/**
 * This is the Spectator, Spotter, Broadcaster App.
 * With this App you can see what's going on from a none driver's point of view.
 * 
 * In Spectator mode, you cannot change the reference car.
 * This mode is intended to be used by other members of your household while you are racing.
 * Therefore, they cannot change the Reference Car.
 * 
 * In Broadcaster / Spotter mode, it is the same experience, except you can change the reference car because you are not driving.
 *

 * @ngdoc apps

 * @param {boolean} BROADCASTER Set to true to be able to change the Reference Car. Defaut is false.
 * @param {boolean} showFPS When any value is seen in the URL for this attribute, the Frames Per Second(FPS) will be shown. Defaults to not show.
